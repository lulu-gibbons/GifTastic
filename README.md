## Giphy API Project

**GifTastic** utilizes the Giphy API to load gifs to the page when the user clicks on a button. 

### GifTastic Details:
* When the user clicks on a food button, 9 gifs will display in a still state (aka not animated)
  * The user can click on each gif to change the current state to animated and make the gif play
  * The user can click the animated gif and change the current state back to a still image
* The user can add a different food (or really anything they want) button to the list of default buttons
  * They do this by typing into the input box and choosing 'Submit'. This will ad a new button.
  
Refreshing the screen will return the page to it's default settings.
